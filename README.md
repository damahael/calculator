# calculator

This project consists in a simple calculator in javascript, which is able to perform basic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Besides the operators, it also contains a group of options, which allow users to clear the display, turn the current number negative and undo the input if they selected the wrong number.
It has keyboard support, so the users can interact with it either by clicking or keyboard. 
The design is intended to emulate a real physical calculator.
